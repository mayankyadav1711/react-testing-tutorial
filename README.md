## Testing with React Testing Library and Jest

### React Testing Library

React Testing Library is a set of helpers that allows you to test React components without relying on their internal implementation details. It promotes testing components in a way that closely resembles how users interact with them.

**Key features:**

- Focuses on testing user behavior.
- Provides utilities to query elements by their accessibility attributes.
- Encourages writing maintainable and readable tests.

### Jest

Jest is a JavaScript testing framework designed to ensure correctness of any JavaScript codebase. It allows you to write tests with an approachable, familiar, and feature-rich API.

**Key features:**

- Zero configuration required.
- Fast and reliable execution.
- Snapshot testing.
- Built-in code coverage.
